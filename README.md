## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## TO RUN THE PROJECT :

KEEP 4 TERMINAL OPENED IN PARALLEL : (let's give them letters in case you learn by heart this anagram):

- G: for git commands
- S: to run laravel server.
- N: for npm
- L: for laravel commands to create models, controllers, etc...
- R: (and eventually one to use the command to show your routes)

G: Git commands ...

S: Run Laravel's server `php artisan serve`

N: use npm who will execute 'vite' (here is version 3.1.8) (which compile ressources (js, css, etc) in folder asset) : `npm run dev`

L: For laraval commands , mostly starting by `php artisan` , `php artisan make:..... `

R: `php artisan route:list`

Then, as usual, open your website on `localhost:8000` , or `localhost:8000/projectName`
